# Ammer-Hajj

I developed this project during my participating in Hajj Hackathon

# Inspiration
Due to the diversity of cultures and languages of pilgrims and the difficulty of communication between them and the organizers and their inability to distinguish between the places in the Hajj, we have developed an application that helps them to reach their destinations using Augmented Reality and voice Recognition.

# What it does
Guiding the crowds or how get losses through using enhanced Augmented Reality and voice Recognition.

# How I built it
x code swift

# I used Four libraries

Ulkit

Speech

Foundation

AR Kit

# Challenges I ran into
Diversity of cultures and languages make it is difficult for organizers to communicate with pilgrims Similarity of Landmarks leads to inability to distinguish between them Some pilgrims are ignorant of modern technology

# Accomplishments that I proud of in this project
Facilitate the pilgrim to know the tracks using enhanced Augmented Reality and voice Recognition Facilitate access to services for people with special needs and illiterates

# What's next for C-049 Ammer
Provide other versions on multiple platforms Follow up the percentage of crowds in pilgrimage places
Provide an application that support offline connection for more efficacy to the user
